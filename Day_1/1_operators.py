# Like any other programming language python also has its own sets of operators.
# operators are the symbols used to carry out mathematical and logical operations.

#Operators in python are
#1.Arithmetic operators
#2.logical operators
#3.Relational/ comparison operators
#4.Asignment operator
#5.Membership Operator
#6.Identity Operator

"""MultiLine OPERATORS"""

############### Arithmetic Operators ############

#Addition (+)
a=1
b=2
print(a+b) #3

#Substraction(-)

a=1
b=2
print(a-b) #-1

#Multiplication (*)

a=5
b=2
print(a*b)#10

#Division

a=4
b=2

print(a/b)#2

#Raise to the power (**)


a=2
print(a ** 3) #8

#Remainder/modulus(%)


a=4
b=5
print(a % 2)#0
print(b%2)#1

#floor division (//)

a=3
print(a/2) #1.5
print(a // 2) #1

a=-3

print(a / 2) #-1.5
print(a // 2) #-2


#Relational Operators

#>,<,==,>=,<=,!= are the relational operators

#Results of relational operations are true/False

a=5
b=2

print(a>b)#True
print(b>a)#False
print(a<b)#FALSE
print(a==b)#False
print(a!=b)#TRUE

#lOGICAL operators
#and ,or,not are the logical operators in python
#The results of logical operators are also True/False

a=5
b=3
c=5

print(a==c or a==b)#TRUE
print(a==c and a==b)#false
print(a!= c or a==b)#FALSE
print(a==c and a!=b)#TRUE

a=True
print(not a) #FALSE
a=5
print(not a) #False

#Assignment Operator

#"=" is the basic assignment operator
institute= "Brodway" # here = is the assignment operator

a=1
print(a) #1

a=a+1
print(a) #2
a+=1 #a=a+1
print(a)#3
#
a=5
a*=2
print(a) #10

#MEMBERSHIP OPERATOR
#'in' and 'not in' are the membership operator
#The result of membership operation is also True/False
print(2 in [1,2,3])#TRUE
print(3 not in [1,2,3])#False
