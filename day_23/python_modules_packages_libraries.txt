1. Each python file inside a folder is a python module
2. A folder containing all the python modules is a python package
python package sometimes has an __init__.py file
3.Collection of all the python packages is called a python library
4.Module name follows the rules of identifier naming.

We can create our own local python library or can import libraries externally.
#To import external libraries we should first install in our local venv.That is done using:
pip install <library_name>
This command install the python library  from "pypI".Pypi is the cloud storage for most of the python libraries
We can also upload our own libraries and make it available globally.
