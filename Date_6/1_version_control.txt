#A same project in production can have multiple versions.These versions are maintained using a version
control system

#If there was no version control,then code sharing would have been difficult.It could be could be
done either by sharing from google-drive or pen-drive which is not efficient

#So we need a version control system for two major resons:

1.For code collaborations
2.For version maintenance

#There are several version control systems likes,git,mercurial,etc.Git is among the most famous ones

#The code written in your local system should be kept somewhere in the cloud for the safety purpose
#We can keep our code to google drive or some other cloud storage.But,they donot understand VCS
#So we keep our code in such cloud platform which understands VCS.For example :Github,Gitlab
Bitbucket etc.

#In this session we use git and github.
